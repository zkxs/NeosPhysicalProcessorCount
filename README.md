# NeosPhysicalProcessorCount

**THIS MOD DOES NOT WORK**  
This is a WIP mod that I decided not to pursue, as the payout:effort ratio was too low. Just use the `-BackgroundWorkers <n>` and `-PriorityWorkers <n>` command line arguments.


<!--

A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod that fixes Neos's physical processor count detection. This allows neos to use the intended number of worker threads without you having to manually use the `-BackgroundWorkers <n>` and `-PriorityWorkers <n>`  command line arguments.

## Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader).
2. Place [PhysicalProcessorCount.dll](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosPhysicalProcessorCount/releases/latest/download/PhysicalProcessorCount.dll) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
3. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Neos logs.
